# Gemini Development Log: ONVIF Web App

This document logs the development process of creating an ONVIF Web Application, assisted by Gemini.

**Session Date:** 2025-10-15

## Project Goal

The user requested to build an open-source web application to connect to multiple ONVIF-compliant cameras for viewing, recording, and playing back video streams.

## Development Log

### 1. Architecture Proposal

*   **Action**: Proposed a three-tier architecture for the web application.
*   **Details**:
    *   **Frontend**: A modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React or Vue).
    *   **Backend**: Node.js with Express, utilizing `node-onvif` for camera control and `FFmpeg` for video stream processing.
    *   **Storage**: SQLite for storing camera configurations and the local filesystem for video recordings.
    *   **Deployment**: Recommended using Docker for easy setup and distribution.
*   **Status**: The user approved the architecture.

### 2. Backend Foundation Setup

*   **Action**: Built the foundational structure for the backend server.
*   **Details**:
    1.  Created the project directory structure (`/backend`, `/backend/src/api`, `/backend/src/db/migrations`).
    2.  Initialized a Node.js project in the `/backend` directory (`npm init -y`).
    3.  Installed core dependencies: `express`, `node-onvif`, `knex`, `sqlite3`.
    4.  Installed a development dependency: `nodemon` for automatic server restarts.
    5.  Created a basic Express server in `backend/src/index.js`.
    6.  Configured the database connection for SQLite using `backend/knexfile.js`.
    7.  Added `start` and `dev` scripts to `package.json`.
    8.  Generated and configured a database migration file to define the `cameras` table schema.
    9.  Executed the migration to create the SQLite database file (`dev.sqlite3`) and the `cameras` table.
*   **Status**: Completed. The user successfully ran the server.

### 3. API Implementation: Camera Management

*   **Action**: Implemented the core API endpoints for managing cameras.
*   **Details**:
    1.  Created a shared database connection module (`backend/src/db/db.js`).
    2.  Created a dedicated service for ONVIF logic (`backend/src/services/onvifService.js`) containing a `testConnection` function.
    3.  Developed the camera API router (`backend/src/api/cameras.js`) with two endpoints:
        *   `GET /api/cameras`: To retrieve a list of all registered cameras.
        *   `POST /api/cameras`: To register a new camera, which performs a connection test before saving the data.
    4.  Integrated the new API router into the main Express application.
*   **Status**: Completed. The user was provided with `curl` commands to test the endpoints.

### 4. Project Documentation and Configuration

*   **Action**: Created essential project-level files.
*   **Details**:
    1.  Generated a `README.md` file containing a project overview, setup instructions, and API documentation.
    2.  Generated a `.gitignore` file with standard rules for a Node.js project to exclude unnecessary files from version control.
*   **Status**: Completed.
